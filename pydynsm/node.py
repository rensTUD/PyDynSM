class Node:
    """
    The Node class is used to store node information and keep track of the total number of 
    Degrees of Freedom (DOFs) of the problem. It introduces automatic bookkeeping in its 
    initialization, which efficiently keeps track of which DOFs belong to which nodes. This 
    makes it easier to assemble matrices from multiple elements.

    Attributes:
        x (float): The x-coordinate of the node.
        z (float): The z-coordinate of the node.
        p (numpy.array):  The load vector of the node.
        dofs (list): The Degrees of Freedom associated with the node.

    Methods:
        clear(): Clears the counting of degrees of freedom and number of nodes.
        __init__(x, z): The constructor for Node class.
        add_load(p): Adds the given loads to the node.
        get_coords(): Returns the coordinates of the node.
        __str__(): Returns a string representation of the node.
