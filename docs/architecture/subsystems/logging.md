# Logging Subsystem

**Location**: `src/pydynsm/logging/`

## Responsibilities

The Logging subsystem is intended to provide logging infrastructure for PyDynSM. Currently, it is a placeholder with minimal implementation.

## Public API

**Status**: Not implemented. The subsystem exists as a placeholder.

**Files**:
- `logger.py`: Empty file (placeholder)
- `__init__.py`: Empty file

## Key Data Structures

None (subsystem not implemented)

## Lifecycle

Not applicable (subsystem not implemented)

## Invariants

None (subsystem not implemented)

## Dependencies

None (subsystem not implemented)

## File Sizes

- `logger.py`: 0 lines (empty)
- `__init__.py`: 0 lines (empty)

## Notes

- This subsystem is planned but not yet implemented
- No logging is currently performed in the codebase
- Print statements are used for user feedback instead of logging
- Future implementation should provide structured logging for:
  - Analysis progress
  - Warnings and errors
  - Debug information
  - Performance metrics
